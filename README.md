### OBSERVER PATTERN

---

As a developer I want to be able to have a system that allows me to perform actions
triggered by events, to accomplish this we designed a solution that should allow us 
to store and manage those events.

Based on a TDD experience we designed the unit tests that would guide the development
of the solution, the goal of this exercise is complement the code base from
`src/eventDispatcher.js` to fulfill successfully all tests defined in `eventDispatcher.spec.js`
(tests can't be modified).

### System Methods :

|   Method              |   Concept                                                                   |
|   ---                 |   ---                                                                       |
|   addEventListener    |   Access the store and save callback for event name                         |
|   removeEventListener |   Access the store and remove callback for event name                       |
|   dispatchEvent       |   Execute every callback in store related to certain event name             |
|   hasListenerFor      |   Access the store and check certain event name has callbacks               |
|   hasCallbackFor      |   Access the store and check certain callback exists for related event name |
|   mixin               |   Mixin concept in Javascript relates to a form of object composition where methods or properties are added to objects without using inheritance   |

### Testing your changes :

To see the actual output of the tests open `index.html` in a browser, you'll see their
status displayed on the page, that should be enough to get you started.
